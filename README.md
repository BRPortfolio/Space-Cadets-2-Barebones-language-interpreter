# Space-Cadets-2-Barebones-language-interpreter
I had a go at making and interpreter for a basic language called Barebones.
There are only 4 commands: 3 to interact with integer variables and 1 which is a specific while loop.

If I had my time again I would have followed a more OOP approach and combined my multiple arraylists into a command object and a varibale object.
I also would have the different parts of my code into multiple methods so that it would be easier to read.
I also need to improve my style with blankspaces. I think I can install a plugin to help.
And of course I need to comment more, however, there was a bit of a time limit.
